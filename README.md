## Chef Table 
Chef Table is a recipe management application that helps users organize and track their cooking process. Users can add recipes to a queue, view their total cooking time and calories, and move recipes to a "currently cooking" section when they're ready to prepare.

## Key Features:
# Recipe Queue: 
Users can add recipes to a queue and manage them easily.
# Total Time & Calories: 
The app automatically calculates and displays the total cooking time and calories of recipes in the queue.
Recipe Preparation: Once a recipe is selected for cooking, it's moved to the "currently cooking" section and removed from the queue.
# Real-Time Updates:
Changes are reflected immediately in the app, keeping track of the time and calories as recipes are added or removed.
Built with React, this project enhances users' cooking experiences with an intuitive interface and dynamic recipe management.
